# Console Commands

You can write modules that will appear in the vehicle console, allowing you to put some custom commands to work. Included in here is an example of a command that allows you to type `land` to land the vehicle. That's a fairly simple example, more to come.

## `module_land` example

Just a simple example of processing a `land` command and using the `VehicleShelll` API to tell the current vehicle to land.
