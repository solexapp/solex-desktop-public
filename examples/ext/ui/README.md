## UI Extensions

UI Extensions appear on the flight screen, and you can put things in them to do whatever you like. You can use the various APIs exposed by Solex to interact with the vehicle, the companion computer, etc. You can also override the main startup image (the "wind turbines" picture) with something else, and change the overall color scheme.
