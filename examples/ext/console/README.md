# Console Commands

You can write modules that will appear in the vehicle console, allowing you to put some custom commands to work. Included in here is an example of a command that allows you to type `land` to land the vehicle. That's a fairly simple example, more to come.

## `module_land` example

Just a simple example of processing a `land` command and using the `VehicleShell` API to tell the current vehicle to land. 

## `module_led_control` example

An example of a call to use `led_control` messages to control the lights on a Solo or similar vehicle.

## `module_led_worker` example

An example of a module that uses SolexCC to control LEDs on a vehicle equipped with SolexCC and the `led` worker module.
