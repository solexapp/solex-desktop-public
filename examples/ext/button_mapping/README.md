## Button Mappings

Button mappings are actions you can assign to a particular gamepad control in the Buttons screen in Solex. In here are some examples of how you might make custom ones, which you might want to do if you have a particular piece of hardware on your vehicle you want to control using sticks and buttons on your controller (or with a gamepad plugged into the USB port on your computer).

The `demo_mappings` module shows examples of the 3 basic types of actions: Buttons, switches, and sticks (sliders, etc).
