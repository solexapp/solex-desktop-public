# Telemetry Bar extensions

Solex allows you to completely replace the Telemetry bar in the flight screen, which displays vehicle status items like speed, altitude, battery level, and so on.

You do this by creating a `TelemBar` implementation that implements a specific interface. The `demo` folder contains an example implementation.
