# Custom mission items

You can make custom mission items and Solex will load them. 

Suppose you have a fixed-wing aircraft that needs a certain type of landing approach. You can assemble the right kind of landing approach manually, but you can
also create a custom landing-approach mission-item type that automates that process, making it easier to create missions with the right kind of landing approach.

## Orbit example

Just a simple example mission item that draws a number of circles around a point with a radius and number of circles specified in the property sheet for the mission item in the UI. 

## Double Survey example

A survey item that works like a normal Survey, but allows for 2 passes at different angles.
